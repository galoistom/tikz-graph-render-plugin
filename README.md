# my Tikz rendering plugings

This is the pluging I wrote for myself for rendering tikz graphs. Even though there are existing plugings that work almost the same, but it just not quite fit with my usage of emacs, especially the "\begin{documents}\end{documents}" are particularly annoying. So I decide to write my own. 

The plugin reuqires latex on your system and divsvgm (but you almost have it as long as you have latex). 

This is the first time I wrote Typescript, which is a pretty good experience >_<

The result is not that good looking, but I won't bother fixing that because I'm lazy [doge]
